## Task

Please build a hero component and a navbar. This should be built as a Next.js project with Typescript. It should be responsive across different devices. Please create a GitHub repo and deploy the project to Vercel. You can choose which CSS framework to work with and the styling is completely up to you. Please be creative with the demo content in the hero component and navbar. The end product should be a Vercel site I can visit to see your work and a GitHub repo to review your code.
